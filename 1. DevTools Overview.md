## Purpose of Document
This document is intended for students and faculty who want to get started with Dev Tools. 
## Brief Overview of Dev Tools
Dev Tools are a collection of tools that allow one to examine, edit, and debug HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on Firefox 
and Chrome for both the desktop and on mobile. 
* Similar to Safari Inspector element 
* Allow you to inspect code
There is a “Developer Edition” of Firefox that contains all of the Dev Tools
* Includes tools that allow you to develop Android code locally 
* https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/

## Key Resources
The information below is key to getting started with accessibility in Dev Tools.  In fall 2017, we worked with the 
Debugger so debugger-specific links are also included below.

------------ | -------------
User page for Firefox Developer Tools. Start here to understand what Dev Tools are and how to use them. | https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools
Slack Communication Channel - used for most Dev Tools conversations. Use the #General channel. | https://devtools-html-slack.herokuapp.com/
Dev Tools IRC Channel - Appears to have less human traffic than the slack channel, but new bug reports are automatically posted here. | #devtools on irc.mozilla.org
Directions for installing the full Mozilla dev environment. Follow the Tasks To Complete except for “Set Up Development Environment” unless you need the full dev environment. If you only need Dev Tools, see link below. | https://github.com/gabrielluong/devtools-getting-started
Directions for installing the Dev Tools environment. **You will need git installed in all environments. The installation of yarn produces many warning messages, this is normal**| https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/blob/master/docs/getting-setup.md
Getting Started instructions for Canada's Undergraduate Capstone Open Source Projects (UCOSP) projects | https://github.com/gabrielluong/devtools-getting-started
GitHub repo for Debugger - This is the repo for the Debugger. The Issues tab will show bugs and you can search on the Accessibility tag. | https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html
Available Debugger Bugs - This link filters the Debugger issues to show the available accessibility bugs that have been identified as useful for a class.  To get a list of all available Debugger bugs, click on the X next to the message “Clear current search query, filters, and sorts”. | https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aaccessibility
People - Jason Last indicated that there are a number of folks in the Debugger community willing to help. | “We have a community team on the debugger (David, Hubert, Wellington, Jaideep) who would be happy to mentor”

## Additional Resources
These resources may be useful during development, but are not key to getting started.
