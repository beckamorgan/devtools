# Introduction to Using the Debugger
This exercise provides practice in using the Mozilla Debugger. It is best to use Firefox (current version 58) for this exercise, the error described below does not show up in Chrome.
## File Set Up:  
1. Go to https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger-examples/tree/master/examples/pythagorean
1. Copy and paste the two files there into two separate text files and save them locally with the same names. 
1. Create a new tab in the Debugging Version of the browser
1. Go to File/Open in the Debugging Version of the browser and open the index.html file 
## Debugger Start
1. Return to the Launch Version of the browser. You should now see a “New Tab” link on the left. 
1. Click on the New Tab link and you should see the debugger. 
   1. Alternate and not recommended: To use the debugger locally, open the debugger in the Debugging Version 
      1. Click on the three horizontal bars in the upper right corner
      1. Select Developer
      1. Select Debugger
   1. Click on the “Math” button.
   1. You should now be able to see both the index.html and Pythagorean.js files in the source list pane (see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Debugger/UI_Tour for a nice intro to the debugger UI)
   1. Click the “Console” tab to see that there was an error regarding the character encoding of the HTML file. 
   1. Add the following code to the index.html file (in the directory, not via the Debugger):
````<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
  <meta charset="utf-8"/>

So that it now contains:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8"/>
    <title>Pythagorean</title>
    <script src="pythagorean.js"></script>
  </head>
  <button onclick="math(2,3)">Math</button>
</html>
````
   3. Refresh the browser tab (F5 on Windows) and click the “Math” button; the error should be gone now.
## Debugging
   1. Select Pythagorean.js in the source list pane
   1. Click the “Debugger” tab
   1. Locate the tool bar that contains the play/pause, step over, step into, and step out buttons (see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Debugger/UI_Tour if you can’t find them). It looks like :
   ![GitHub Logo](/images/debuggerToolBar.png)                                        
   And is below the menu that contains “Console” and “Debugger”
   1. Note that the play/pause button is currently in the “paused” state
   1. Click the “Math” button - you shouldn’t see anything happening…
   1. Click the line number next to “var bar = 4;” to set a breakpoint. Should look like:   
   ![GitHub Logo](/images/debuggerCodeSnippet.png)  
   1. Click the “Math” button to run it…now you see things happening!
   1. Click the “step into” button to watch the variables change as the code executes
   1. In the end you should note that the function (math) does not return anything
   1. Add the return in front of the call to pythagorean(a, b) in the text file so that the line reads:
   
   ````
   return pythagorean(a,b);
   ````
   exit and save it 
   
   11. Refresh the tab that you are using for debugging
   12. Repeat stepping through the function until the function terminates, now you can “see” that it is returning a value (you will see the change in the code).
