## Make a Change to the Debugger
**Pre-requisite:** Must have the DevTools Debugger developer environment set up with a launchpad browser instance that contains the debugger code and a display browser instance that contains the code that the debugger is working on. 

1. First, ensure that you are viewing the "LaunchPad" browser (originally started with the URL `localhost:8000`) and that it shows the debugger (i.e., the tab name is "Debugger").

> Note the header, "WatchExpressions", in the right panel.

2. We are now ready to edit the debugger. Go back to *your* directory with the code that you cloned from `https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html.git`. 
   1. In the code base, edit the file `debugger.html/assets/panel/debugger.properties` as follows: 
   2. Go to the line that contains the following:  `watchExpressions.header=Watch Expressions`
   3. Modify that line to add a random character, e.g., let's add an exclamation point at the end of this expression: `watchExpressions.header=WatchExpressions!`
   4. Save the file; then reload the debugger tab of the "LaunchPad" browser 
3. View the change in the “WatchExpressions!” heading.
### Note:
* Make sure that you are looking at the debugger in the launchpad browser instance.
