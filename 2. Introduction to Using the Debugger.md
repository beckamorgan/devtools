# Introduction to Using the Debugger
This exercise provides practice in using the Mozilla Debugger. As mentioned in the DevTools Overview, the Debugger is one tool in the suite of developer tools for both Mozilla and Chrome. This exercise is intended to show how to use the Debugger and does not require the development environment to be installed.  It is best to use Firefox (current version 58) for this exercise, the error described below may not show up in Chrome. 
## File Set Up:  
1. Go to https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger-examples/tree/master/examples/pythagorean
1. Copy and paste the two files there into two separate text files and save them in a separate directory with the same names. 
1. Create a new tab in Firefox
1. Go to File/Open in Firefox and open the `index.html` file 
## Debugger Start
1. To start the debugger:
   1. Click on the three horizontal bars in the upper right corner of the tool bar
   1. Select Web Developer/Developer
   1. Select Debugger
 1. Click on the “Math” button.
 1. You may need to click on the directory in which you saved the files in the `Sources` pane in the lower left corner.  You should now be able to see both the `index.html` and `Pythagorean.js` files in the source list pane (see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Debugger/UI_Tour for a nice intro to the debugger UI). 
   1. Click the “Console” tab to see that there was an error regarding the character encoding of the HTML file. 
   1. Add the following code to the index.html file (in the directory, not via the Debugger):
````<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
  <meta charset="utf-8"/>

So that it now contains:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8"/>
    <title>Pythagorean</title>
    <script src="pythagorean.js"></script>
  </head>
  <button onclick="math(2,3)">Math</button>
</html>
````
   3. Refresh the browser tab (F5 on Windows) and click the “Math” button; the error should be gone now.
## Debugging
   1. Select Pythagorean.js in the source list pane
   1. Click the “Debugger” tab
   1. Locate the tool bar that contains the play/pause, step over, step into, and step out buttons (see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Debugger/UI_Tour if you can’t find them). It looks like :
   ![GitHub Logo](/images/debuggerToolBar.png)                                        
   And is below the menu that contains “Console” and “Debugger”
   1. Note that the play/pause button is currently in the “paused” state
   1. Click the “Math” button - you shouldn’t see anything happening…
   1. Click the line number next to “var bar = 4;” to set a breakpoint. Should look like:   
   ![GitHub Logo](/images/debuggerCodeSnippet.png)  
   1. Click the “Math” button to run it…now you see things happening!
   1. Click the “step into” button to watch the variables change as the code executes
   1. In the end you should note that the function (math) does not return anything
   1. Add the return in front of the call to pythagorean(a, b) in the text file so that the line reads:
   
   ````
   return pythagorean(a,b);
   ````
   exit and save it 
   
   11. Refresh the tab that you are using for debugging
   12. Repeat stepping through the function until the function terminates, now you can “see” that it is returning a value (you will see the change in the code).
